# Smart Rain Detection for Automated Irrigation 🌧️

## 🌱 Project Overview
This project is about creating a smart system that can **detect rain automatically** and **turn off the irrigation motor** when it starts raining.  
The main goal is to save **water and electricity**, especially for farmers who often forget to turn off the pumps during rainfall.  

Even though this internship is based on *Automotive Object Detection*, I wanted to apply similar computer vision ideas in the **farming domain** — using AI to detect environmental conditions and automate actions, just like how cars detect obstacles or rain using sensors.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
When it rains, most irrigation pumps continue running unnecessarily.  
This causes a lot of **water wastage** and **power loss**.  
To solve this, I’m building a system that can **detect rain using AI** and **automatically stop the motor** when rainfall is detected.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Hugging Face Models (for rain or weather detection)  
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## 🧠 What I Did in Week 1
- Understood the problem statement and real-world importance.  
- Researched how object detection and computer vision can help detect rain.  
- Explored Hugging Face models for image classification and weather detection.  
- Set up my Python environment and started basic experiments with image reading and processing using OpenCV.  
- Created this GitHub repository to track my weekly progress.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Implement rain detection using a Hugging Face pre-trained model.  
- Simulate motor ON/OFF logic based on detection results.  
- Prepare final report and presentation for submission.
